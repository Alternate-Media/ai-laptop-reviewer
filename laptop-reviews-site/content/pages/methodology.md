At **Laptop Verdict**, we don't just review laptops; we investigate them. Our methodology is designed to protect professionals from marketing claims that don't hold up under sustained load.

## The Hierarchy of Trust
We weight our analysis based on the specific expertise of technical entities:
1. **Component Forensics**: Lenovo PSREF, HP QuickSpecs, and PanelLook.
2. **Sustained Load Testing**: Jarrod's Tech and Notebookcheck.
3. **Internal Engineering**: LaptopMedia and iFixit.
4. **Professional Workflow**: Phoronix (Linux) and ArtIsRight (Color Science).

## Our Standards
- **Sustained Performance**: We care about TDP after 60 minutes, not 60 seconds.
- **Build Integrity**: Chassis flex and hinge reliability are non-negotiable.
- **Visual Reality**: Real-world nits and PWM flickering detection.
- **QC Patterns**: We aggregate community reports to find systemic faults.
